# Suport-Vector-Machine
I use the Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree classification models to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions.

I use a real dataset with information about transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders to train each of these models. I then use the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not.

I use Scikit-Learn and the Python API offered by the Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) library, a high-performance library for ML modeling.
