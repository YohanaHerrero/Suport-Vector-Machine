# Suport-Vector-Machine
I use Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree classification models to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions.

I use a real dataset (creditcard.csv, from Kaggle) with information about transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders to train each of these models. I then use the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not. I model the problem as a binary classification problem. A transaction belongs to the positive class (1) if it is a fraud, otherwise it belongs to the negative class (0).

I use Scikit-Learn and the Python API offered by the Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) library, a high-performance library for ML modeling. I carry out the following tasks:
Dataset Preprocessing
Dataset Train/Test Split
Build a Decision Tree Classifier model with Scikit-Learn
Build a Decision Tree Classifier model with Snap ML
Evaluate the Scikit-Learn and Snap ML Decision Tree Classifiers
Build a Support Vector Machine model with Scikit-Learn
Build a Support Vector Machine model with Snap ML
Evaluate the Scikit-Learn and Snap ML Support Vector Machine Models
